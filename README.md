# Recipeak

A friendly recipe app.

Created by Alex Fukui for Thinkful.

[Github](https://github.com/psychicbologna/recipeak-client)
[Demo](https://recipeak-client.now.sh/)

## Tech

Server: Node, npm, Express.js, xss

Database: PostgresSQL, Postgrator, Knex.

Testing: Chai, supertest.

Deployed on Heroku.

Uses RESTful API, cors, and authentication middleware with JWT bearer tokens.

## Summary

Recipeak's primary function is to store your favorite recipes in one place. You can add, edit and delete these recipes and their components. The server was designed to use a database with associated tables for users, recipes, units and ingredients.

### How to Use

See the [client-side](https://github.com/psychicbologna/recipeak-client/blob/master/README.md) documentation for a step-by-step on using Recipeak.

## Set up

Complete the following steps to start a new project (NEW-PROJECT-NAME):

1. Clone this repository to your local machine `git clone BOILERPLATE-URL NEW-PROJECTS-NAME`
2. `cd` into the cloned repository.
3. Make a fresh start of the git history for this project with `rm -rf .git && git init`
4. Install the node dependencies `npm install`
5. Move the example Environment file to `.env` that will be ignored by git and read by the express server `mv example.env .env`
6. Edit the contents of the `package.json` to use NEW-PROJECT-NAME instead of `"name": "express-boilerplate",`

## Scripts

Start the application `npm start`

Start nodemon for the application `npm run dev`

Run the tests `npm test`

Migrations `npm run migrate`, `npm run migrate:test`; append with step number (eg, `npm run migrate -- 0`)

\* In package.json for these scripts, you may replace fields `recipeak` and `recipeak-api` with preferred Postgres user and database.

\*\* Truncate might be useful when the test database is accidentally populated.

## Deploying

When your new project is ready for deployment, add a new Heroku application with `heroku create`. This will make a new git remote called "heroku" and you can then `npm run deploy` which will push to this remote's master branch.

### Composing Units

Unit conversion was the most complex aspect of this project to tackle, and one I would like to expand upon in future builds.

#### Unit Conversion

Recipeak's unit conversions are calculated both as part of the response body when a recipe is sent out and when an ingredient is created.

For now, the two systems of measurement that an ingredient can be converted between are `US` and `Metric`. Each unit converts to one other unit in the opposite system. `Approximate`, `Custom` and `Base` units cannot be converted.

Ratios (`cnv_ratio`) and which unit to convert to (`cnv_to`) are stored in the units table as part of a unit's `unit_data`. When a recipe is requested, a `conversion` object is created for each applicable ingredient that calculates its opposite and determines how it will be displayed. All units have `abbreviated`, `singular` and `plural` forms.

Conversions can also be generated live when an ingredient is added or edited using the `/convert` endpoints, allowing for dynamic conversion.

#### Custom Units

Depending on its `unit_set` definition, an ingredient will be sent out with corresponding unit data. For most units, this data doesn't need to be stored with the ingredient - the reference on the units table is enough, and the services will retrieve the right data. But an ingredient with a `custom` unit will additionally store custom unit data. When viewed, the ingredient will have custom singular and plural forms.

In future builds, custom units could be scaled to a point where users could create their own unit sets, and information collected about preferred units could be used to decide new types of units to add to the units table.

### /units & /units/:unit_set

#### GET /units

- Note:

  The data in the units table is meant to be static and predefined. If running locally, the units table should be migrated and populated before recipes and ingredients - the client will break down otherwise.

- Success:

```javascript
// Code: 200
// res.body
{
  "units":
    //Non-convertible units.
    "base | apprx": [
      {
        "id": 1, //The unit's id
        "unit_set":"none", //The unit's primary name.
        "unit_data": {
          "class":"base", //The class of the unit.
          "unit_plural":"", //How the unit should be displayed if the ingredient amount calls for plural form.
          "unit_single":"" //How the unit should be displayed if the ingredient amount calls for singular form.
        }
      },
    ...],

    //Convertible units
    "us | metric":[

          "cnv_to":"g", //The unit it converts to
          "cnv_ratio":"28.3495", //The ratio to multiply the unit by to convert it to the other unit.
          "unit_abbr":"oz",
          "unit_plural":"ounces",
          "unit_single":"ounce"
        }
      },
      ...]
}
```

- Errors:

```javascript
// Code: 404
// In event the units don't exist in the database
{
  "error": "Sorry, the units don't exist"
}
```

### GET units/:unit_set

- Note:

  Retrieves unit data by unit set. Doesn't work for custom unit sets, the unit data here is only retrieved with a defined ingredient.

- Success:

```javascript
// Code: 200
// res.body
{
  "class": "Approximate", //The unit's class
  "unit_plural": "truckload", // plural form
  "unit_single": "truckloads" // singular form
}
```

- Errors:

```javascript
// Code: 404
// In event the unit doesn't exist in the database
{
  "error": "Sorry, that unit doesn't exist"
}
```

### /convert

#### GET /convert/:amount/:unitSet

- URL Params:

```javascript
amount = [Integer]; //The amount of the ingredient, eg. the 1 in '1 lb' or the 3 in '3 sprigs'
unitSet = [string]; //The abbreviation (abbr) of the unit set of the ingredient to convert FROM.
```

- Success

```javascript
// Code: 200
// res.body (if sent /convert/3/lb)
{
  "amount":1.362,
  "class":"Metric",
  "unit_abbr":"kg",
  "unit_plural":"kilograms",
  "unit_single":"kilogram"
}
```
